    "## Motivation\n",
    "facility location problems:[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Facility location problems have applications in a wide variety of industries. For supply chain management and logistics, this problem  can be used to find the optimal location for stores, factories, warehouses, etc. Other applications range from public policy (e.g. positioning  police officers in a city), telecommunications (e.g. cell towers in a network), and even particle physics (e.g. separation distance between repulsive charges). Another application of the facility location problem is to determine the locations for natural gas transmission equipment. Finally, facility location problems can be applied to cluster analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A large supermarket chain in the UK needs to build warehouses for a set of supermarkets it is opening in Northern England. The locations of the supermarkets have been decided, but the locations of the warehouses have yet to be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several good candidate locations for the warehouses have been identified, but decisions must be made regarding \n",
    "how many warehouses to open and at which candidate locations to build them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening many warehouses would be advantageous as this would reduce the average distance a truck has to drive from the warehouse to the supermarket, and hence reduce the delivery cost. However, opening a warehouse has a fixed cost associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets and Indices\n",
    "\n",
    "$i \\in I$: Index and set of supermarket (or customer) locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "$j \\in J$: Index and set of candidate warehouse (or facility) locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$: Fixed cost associated with constructing facility $j \\in J$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$d_{i,j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$: Distance between facility $j \\in J$ and customer $i \\in I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_{i,j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$: Cost of shipping between candidate facility site $j \\in J$ and customer location $i \\in I$. We assume that this cost is proportional to the distance between the facility and the customer. That is, $c_{i,j} = \\alpha \\cdot d_{i,j}$, where $\\alpha$ is the cost per mile of driving, adjusted to incorporate the average number of trips a delivery truck would be expected to make over a five year period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "$select_{j} \\in \\{0, 1 \\}$: This variable is equal to 1 if we build a facility at candidate location $j \\in J$; and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "$0 \\leq assign_{i,j} \\leq 1$: This non-negative continuous variable determines the fraction of supply received by customer $i \\in I$ from facility $j \\in J$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total costs**. We want to minimize the total cost to open and operate the facilities. This is the sum of the cost of opening facilities and the cost related to shipping between facilities and customers. This total cost measures the tradeoff between the cost of building a new facility and the total delivery cost over a five year period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{Max} \\quad Z = \\sum_{j \\in J} f_{j} \\cdot select_{j} + \\sum_{j \\in J} \\sum_{i \\in I} c_{i,j} \\cdot assign_{i,j}\n",
    "\\tag{0}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demand**. For each customer  $i \\in I$ ensure that its demand is fulfilled. That is, the sum of the fraction received from each facility for each customer must be equal to 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_{j \\in J} assign_{i,j} = 1 \\quad \\forall i \\in I\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shipping**. We need to ensure that we  only ship from facility $j \\in J$,  if that facility has actually been built.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "assign_{i,j} \\leq select_{j} \\quad \\forall i \\in I \\quad \\forall j \\in J\n",
    "\\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}"
